# YACC Custom Language
We will be using Flex and Bison - they're both almost identical to Lex and Yacc (including the flags!)

> Warning: Please use an Unix environment. This was tried on Fedora 35, but should work with no problem in any other similar Unix OSes. I provide any assistance for Windows, be it MinGW or WSL2.

Dependencies:
1. Flex (both *base* and *devel*)
2. Bison (both *base* and *devel*)
3. Graphviz

## How to run any of the phases?
To run a particular phase, you must run their associated shell script file.
For example, to run Phase 1, type the following in your terminal:
```
$ sh <name_of_the_phase>.sh
```

## Phase 1:
*Self-explanatory, therefore skipped. Try playing with the code, if you are not familiar.*

## Phase 2:
You're recommended to modify only **main.y**, **main.l** and **valid_code.lang**.

The `%%...%%` part in **main.y** contains your grammar. Make sure to look into the code I've provided - the file name is **main.y** (the problem statement can be accessed in **valid_code.lang** - here, you can place your own problem statement to be executed), and modify the grammar as per your requirements. Be sure to assign all the tokens inside the **main.l** code.

Try to see that:
1. Your code must not have any orphan characters (hidden tabs & spaces?).
2. You must define the tokens in the main.l file.
3. Terminal values are in small cases, and non-terminals (tokens) are in capital (You may also add a string using '...').

This shell script is actually pretty easy to understand - It will generate some files:
- **main.tab.c** and **main.tab.h** are generated by the *bison* `-d` flag, **lex.yy.c** is generated by the *flex* command, and **a.out** by the *gcc* command.
- The **main.output** is actually generated by the *bison* `--report=states,itemsets` flag, and the **main.dot** by the *bison* `--graph` flag.
- The **main.png** file is generated by the `dot -T png main.dot -o main.png` command, which is used to inoke a Graphviz plot in PNG format.
